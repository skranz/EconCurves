  wPS:
    descr: |
      The intermediate run price-setting real wage equation.
      Firms will add a markup mu on the wages.
      Hence, workers only get a fraction (1/1+mu) of their MPL.
    formula:  (1/(1+mu))*MPL
  wWS:
    descr: |
      The intermediate run real wage-setting curve.
      Offered efficiency wages increase with the total labor demand. 
    formula: w_min + w_slope*y
  WWS:
    descr: The nominal wage agreed on in the wage negotiations
    formula: EP * wWS

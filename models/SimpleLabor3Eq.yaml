  MPL:
    descr: Marginal product of labor
    formula: lambda 
  wPS:
    descr: |
      The intermediate run price-setting real wage equation.
      Firms will add a markup mu on the wages.
      Hence, workers only get a fraction (1/1+mu) of their MPL.
    formula:  (1/(1+mu))*MPL
  wWS:
    descr: |
      The intermediate run real wage-setting curve.
      Offered efficiency wages increase with the total labor demand. 
    formula: w_min + w_slope*y
  WWS:
    descr: The nominal wage agreed on in the wage negotiations
    formula: EP * wWS(y)
# Labor market if inflation expectiation were correct

# Labor market in which inflation expectations may be incorrect
  w:
    descr: the actual real wages are determined by the price setting curve
    formula: W / P
  W:
    descr: the actual nominal wages
    formula: EP * wWS(y)

    descr: |
      marginal cost of production for firms, given by
      the piece-labor-cost
    formula: W / lambda
  mc:
    descr: marginal costs in baskets
    formula: w / lambda
  P:
    descr: prices are a percentage markup above marginal costs
    formula: (1+mu)*MC
  pi:
    descr: the actual inflation rate
    formula: (P-lag_P)/lag_P    
  # adaptive inflation expectations

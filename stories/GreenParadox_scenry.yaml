title: 'Hotelling Model, Carbon Leakage and the Green Paradoxon'

descr: |
  This is an illustration of supply side aspects of climate change.
  
  Based on a classical Hotelling model, it studies how perfectly competitive
  owners of fossil fuels ressources adapt their ressource extraction path
  as a function of current and expected future climate treaties.
  
  It is motivated by Hans-Werner Sinn's work on the Green Paradoxon.

    title: 'Hotelling Model: Effect of interest rate'  
    tell: |
      We simulate the ressource extraction path and 
      markups of a Hotelling model for a low and high
      interst rate.
      
      A higher interest rate leads to faster ressource
      extraction, since 
      it is then more attractive to quickly extract the ressources and invest
      the profits on the capital market.
    
      You can change the parameters of the two scenarios and 
      press run to study the effects.

    statements:
      S1: 
        y1: If the interest rate is higher, the markups and prices have a higher growth rate
        n2: If the interest rate is lower, the markups and prices have a higher growth rate
        n3: If the interest rate is higher, the markups and prices have a lower growth rate
        y4: If the interest rate is lower, the markups and prices have a lower growth rate
        e: | 
          The Hotelling rule in our simple model with competitive ressource markets,
          and constant variable extraction costs, says that the growth rate of the markups
          is equal to the interest rate.
      S2:
        n1: If the interest rate is higher, fewer ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        y2: If the interest rate is lower, fewer ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        y3: If the interest rate is higher, more ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        n4: If the interest rate is lower, more ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        e: | 
          If the interest rate is higher, ressource owners have stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market. So a higher interest rate leads to earlier extraction of the ressources.    
      S3:    
        y1: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are lower if the interest rate is higher.
        n2: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are higher if the interest rate is higher.          
        n3: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are lower if the interest rate is lower.          
        y4: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are higher if the interest rate is lower.          
        e: |
          Higher interest rate give ressource owners stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market. Therefore ressource prices will start at a lower level if interest rates
          are higher.
      S4:
        n1: A lower interest rate leads to an earlier extraction of the ressources.
        y2: A lower interest rate leads to an later extraction of the ressources.
        n3: A higher interest rate leads to an later extraction of the ressources.
        y4: A higher interest rate leads to an earlier extraction of the ressources.
        e: | 
          Higher interest rate give ressource owners stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market.
      S5:
        n: A lower interest rate always leads to a lower total extraction of ressources.
        y: A lower interest rate always leads to a lower total extraction of ressources.
        e: | 
          Higher interest rate give ressource owners stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market.
    quiz:
      Q1:
        question: |
          For which interest rate `i` will be the same amount of
          ressources be extracted in each of the T periods?
          (You can try out changing the simulations.)
        answer: 0
        explain: |
          Only if the interest rate is 0, markups, prices and the
          amount of extracted ressources will stay constant in every
          period.
          
          If we would have an infinite horizon model (T=$\infty$),
          the Hotelling model only yields sensible results if we
          have a strictly positive interest rate.

    
  treaty1:
    title: 'Partial climate treaty and Carbon Leakage'  
    tell: |
      Let us now compare the effects of a partial climate treaty.
      We assume that the world consists of a large numbers of identical
      countries that use fosil fuels and thereby pollute the atmossphere with CO2.
      
      A fraction `alpha` of the world's countries, shall particpate in a climate 
      treaty that restricts their use of fosil fuels to a level `start_q_tr`.
      For now, we assume that the treaty starts immediately.
      
      We see how the treaty reduces the total CO2 emmissions compared to the
      scenario without any treaty. However, part of the
      reduction in the treaty countries is offset by the increased emmissions in
      the non-treaty countries.
      The reason is that the reduced demand from treaty
      countries reduces the price for fosil fuels and thereby spurs the fosil fuel
      usage in non-treaty countries. Furthermore if the emmission cap stays constant,
      treaty countries may use more carbon in later years than without a treatment,
      since prices stay at lower levels in all periods.
      
      Play around with the parameters `alpha` and `start_q_tr` to see how they affect 
      the results.

  The model first allows some interactive simulations of a simple Hotelling model
  for the extraction of fossil fuels. One can study and is quizzed on the effects 
  of the interest rate on the path of fossil fuel extraction which is tightly
  linked to the path of CO2 emmissions.

  Then the effects of climate treaties in which parts of the world participate
  are studied. 
  If treaty states reduce their demand, world-wide fossil fuel prices go down, 
  and as a reaction non-treaty states tend to burn more fossil fuels.
  The simulations illustrate this "Carbon-Leakage" effect.
  It is illustrated how climate treaties that comprehend only a medium fraction of the
  world's countries can be much less effective than treates with a world-wide coverage.

  Finally, the model can illustrate the so called "Green Paradox", a termed coined
  by the German economist Hands-Werner Sinn. A treaty that prescribes a gradual
  decline of CO2 emmission or which takes time to be in place, can lead to an
  increase of current CO2 emmssions, since ressource owners anticipate that reduced
  future demand makes their ressource less valuable. In effect, such a treaty may
  (but not neccessarily does) paradoxically lead to a less desirable path of CO2
  emmissions than in the absence of any treaty.

    tell: |
      We simulate the ressource extraction path and 
      markups of a Hotelling model for a low and high
      interst rate.
      
      You can change the parameters of the two scenarios and 
      press run to study the effects.
    background: |
      Harold Hotelling derived 1931 the famous Hotelling rule
      in his article "The Economics of Exhaustible Resources".
      
      He considers a competitive world wide ressource market
      with many small ressource owners who have secure property rights.
      
      The key intuition of the model is that when determining 
      how much to extract today, a ressource owner compares two
      options: 
      
        1.  extract a ressource today and invest the markup $p_t-c$
            in the capital market at interest rate $i$
            
        2.  wait for one period and then extract and sell 
            the ressource at the new price $p_{t+1}$
      
      To have an equilibrium in the ressource market, the ressource
      owner must be indifferent between two options. This means
      that in equilibrium the markups $p_t-c$ must grow over time
      with a growth rate equal to the interest rate $i$.
      
      This Hotelling Rule allows predictions of the effects of 
      an exogenous (long lasting) change in the interest rate
      on ressource prices and the timing of its extraction.
      
      Ceteris paribus, a higher interest rate leads to faster ressource
      extraction, since 
      it is then more attractive to quickly extract the ressources and invest
      the profits on the capital market.

    statements:
      S1: 
        y1: If the interest rate is higher, the markups and prices have a higher growth rate
        n2: If the interest rate is lower, the markups and prices have a higher growth rate
        n3: If the interest rate is higher, the markups and prices have a lower growth rate
        y4: If the interest rate is lower, the markups and prices have a lower growth rate
        e: | 
          The Hotelling rule in our simple model with competitive ressource markets,
          and constant variable extraction costs, says that the growth rate of the markups
          is equal to the interest rate.
      S2:
        n1: If the interest rate is higher, fewer ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        y2: If the interest rate is lower, fewer ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        y3: If the interest rate is higher, more ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        n4: If the interest rate is lower, more ressources are extracted in period t=1.
        e: | 
          If the interest rate is higher, ressource owners have stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market. So a higher interest rate leads to earlier extraction of the ressources.    
      S3:    
        y1: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are lower if the interest rate is higher.
        n2: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are higher if the interest rate is higher.          
        n3: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are lower if the interest rate is lower.          
        y4: The ressource prices in the first period t=1 are higher if the interest rate is lower.          
        e: |
          Higher interest rate give ressource owners stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market. Therefore ressource prices will start at a lower level if interest rates
          are higher.
      S4:
        n1: A lower interest rate leads to an earlier extraction of the ressources.
        y2: A lower interest rate leads to an later extraction of the ressources.
        n3: A higher interest rate leads to an later extraction of the ressources.
        y4: A higher interest rate leads to an earlier extraction of the ressources.
        e: | 
          Higher interest rate give ressource owners stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market.
      S5:
        n: A lower interest rate always leads to a lower total extraction of ressources.
        y: A lower interest rate always leads to a lower total extraction of ressources.
        e: | 
          Higher interest rate give ressource owners stronger
          incentives to immediately extract the ressources and invest their earnings in the 
          capital market.

    quiz:
      Q1:
        question: |
          For which interest rate `i` will be the same amount of
          ressources be extracted in each of the T periods?
          (You can try out changing the simulations.)
        answer: 0
        expl: |
          Only if the interest rate is 0, markups, prices and the
          amount of extracted ressources will stay constant in every
          period.
          
          Note that if we have an infinite horizon model (T=$\infty$),
          the Hotelling model only yields sensible results if we hae
          have a strictly positive interest rate.

    title: 'Partial climate treaty and Carbon Leakage'  
    tell: |
      Let us now compare the effects of a partial climate treaty.
      We assume that the world consists of a large numbers of identical
      countries that use fosil fuels and thereby pollute the atmossphere with CO2.
      
      A fraction `alpha` of the world's countries, shall particpate in a climate 
      treaty that restricts their use of fosil fuels to a level `start_q_tr`.
      For now, we assume that the treaty starts immediately.
      
      Play around with the parameters `alpha` and `start_q_tr` to see how they affect 
      the results.
  
    background: |
      
      We see how the treaty reduces the total CO2 emmissions compared to the
      scenario without any treaty. However, part of the
      reduction in the treaty countries is offset by the increased emmissions in
      the non-treaty countries.
      
      This effect is often referred as "Carbon Leakage": The carbon emmissions that
      are saved somewhere, sometime can leak out at some other place or time.
      
      The reason for Carbon leakage in our setting is that the reduced demand from treaty
      countries reduces the price for fosil fuels and thereby spurs the fosil fuel
      usage in non-treaty countries.
      
      Furthermore if the emmission cap stays constant,
      treaty countries may use more carbon in later years than without a treatment.
      That effect arises because producers have more ressources left in later years
      and therefore sell them at lower prices in those later years.

    quiz:
      Q1:
        question: |
          If 50% of the world participates in a treaty that caps their CO2 emmissions
          at 50% of their emmission in period t=1 without any treaty (business-as-usual),
          by how much will the treaty reduce **world wide** CO2 emmission in t=1 compared to 
          no treaty?
        choices:
          - By 50%
          - By 25%
          - By less than 25%*
          - Between 25% and 50%
          - By more than 50%
        expl: |
          If the non-treaty countries kept
          their CO2 emmissions constant, the treaty would reduce world-wide
          CO2 emmissions by 25%. However, the lower demand from treaty countries
          will reduce prices for fossil fuels. Due to the lower prices, non-treaty
          countries will consumer more fossil fuels and emmit more CO2 if the treaty
          is in place. This "carbon leakage" causes total emmission to be reduced
          by less than 25%.

    title: Carbon Leakage in Partial Climate Treaty
    tell: |
      We now study more systematically how for a given climate treaty
      that obliges member states to emmit at most `start_q_tr`,
      the world wide CO2 emmissions vary as a function of the fraction
      of the world that participates in the treaty.
      
      You can see from the plot that only with sufficiently large
      participation there is a reduction of total CO2 emmissions.

      Before we looked at treaties that start immediately and have a constant
      emmission level for all years.
      
      We now assume that a treaty starts in period `start_t` and that the
      emmission cap shrinks by the percentage `shrink` each year.
      
      Somewhat paradoxically, such treaties that take time to be enforced
      or who shrink the allowed emmissions over time,
      can have the negative effect that
      current CO2 emmissions increase due to the treaty. The reason is that
      owners of fossil fuels ressources correctly predict that the the treaty
      will reduce future profits from fossil fuel sales. This means keeping
      fossil fuels in the earth is less attractive and owners have stronger
      incentives to sell more fossil fuel today.
      Hans-Werner Sinn calls this effect the "Green Paradoxon".
      
      Play around with the parameters of the treaty to see when and how strongly
      the green paradoxon arises in our model.
      The underlying model is still the simple
      Hotelling Model augmented by the treaty.

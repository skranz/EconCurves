The R package EconCurve helps to build interactive shiny illustrations and exercises on the web for simple or
intermediate economic models. One can define the basic
model specifying parameters, variables, curves and panes and
stories that illustrate the model dynamics or comparative statics given some shocks. The stories can have the form
of interactive exercises that ask the user, e.g. how some
curve will shift, or where in the figures, we find some
specific variable.

Stories and models can be specified in relatively simple
yaml files that can contain mathematical expressions using
R syntax.

Ufortunately, the package is not yet documented.

You can try out some stories (in German) on:

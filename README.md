The R package EconCurves helps to build interactive shiny illustrations and exercises on the web for simple or
intermediate economic models. 

One can define 
`models` by specifying parameters, variables, curves and panes.

One can also specify `stories` that illustrate the model dynamics or comparative statics given some shocks. Stories can also have the form of interactive exercises. The user is then asked questions, like how some
curve will shift, or, where in the figures, we find some
specific variable.

Stories and models can be specified in relatively simple
yaml files that can contain mathematical expressions using
R syntax. You can take a look in the model and stories folder for examples.

Ufortunately, the package is not yet documented.

You can try out some stories (in German) on:
